### Runner
https://github.com/Olical/conjure

### Debugging
chrome attach
on dap.continue(), read the launch.json file again
if pwa-chrome to chrome worked, why not pwa-node to node?
why the pwa prefixes?

### JSON
json5 (commnets, trailing comma, etc.) not available for lsp?
lsp for launc.json like in vscode
